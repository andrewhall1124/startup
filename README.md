# how to resolve a git conflict
We resolve the conflict by modifying the file to remove the textual conflict delimiters and modifying the file to keep the changes we want. When we are done editing, our file contains what we want from both commits.

# arrow function syntax examples
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);

# JSON
Type	Example
string	"crockford"
number	42
boolean	true
array	[null,42,"crockford"]
object	{"a":1,"b":"crockford"}
null	null

Note that in this example, JSON cannot represent the JavaScript undefined object and so it gets dropped when converting from JavaScript to JSON.

# Regular Expressions
Examples

const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true

# Rest

function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true

# Spread

function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}

# Destructring

const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2

# Exceptions (throw, try, catch, finally)

function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed

# Promises

const delay = (msg, wait) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg, wait);
  }, 1000 * wait);
};

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Code executing in the promise
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    delay('In promise', i);
  }
});

// Code executing after the promise
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  delay('After promise', i);
}

// OUTPUT:
//   In promise 0
//   After promise 0
//   In promise 1
//   After promise 1
//   In promise 2
//   After promise 2

# Await Async

function orderPizza(flavorRequest) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Ordering " + flavorRequest + " flavored pizza!")
    if (flavorRequest == "pepperoni") {
      resolve("Making pepperoni pizza")
    }
    else{
      reject("Sorry we only have pepperoni")
    }
  })
}

function makePizza(response) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    console.log("Making pepperoni pizza")
    resolve("Pizza is ready.")
  })

    const response = await orderPizza(flavor)
    console.log("Order received")
    const processedResponse = await makePizza(response)
    console.log(processedResponse)
  }
  catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}

# Notes from simon service project

Adding fetch commands isn't as difficult as I thought it would be. Making my simon project a service through node.js and express was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Now I just need to figure it out for my startup project to really internalize everythin.

# Notes from simon login project

At this point there is so much going on in my Simon Project that I don't really understand every line of code, but I think when I finish my startup project it will make more sense.
