Learning how to us GitHub and VS Code together has been an interesting experience. It has not been as straightforward or intuitive as I would have thought. The fundamentals of pushing and pullings commits between GitHub and my personal computer make sense however, because when coding with multiple people, seeing the version history is very important. I definitely appreciate the GitLens add-on.
